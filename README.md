## Problem Domain

A place to find your new pet! Search animal type, location, and more.

There are so many animals that are put down every year, we want to make it accessible for people to find the pet of their dreams from a shelter, and in the meantime save an animals life!

## Frameworks and Libraries

We will be using API's from [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) and [AdoptAPet](https://www.adoptapet.com/public/apis/pet_list.html).
